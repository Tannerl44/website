# website
www.tannerlaird.com http files


I started this website as practice and to familiarize myself more with AWS and Github. Originally this was built out and deployed using an s3 bucket and updating with github using jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master. In January of 2024 I migrated the site to AWS Amplify with github connection. I plan to recreate this website at www.tanneralaird.com using the original s3 bucket method as practice. Other option recommendations to test and practice with are appreciated!
